    description: Custom content at header, body and footer sections are supported via templating.
    content: Field data of a corresponding row is displayed as the cell content by default, this can be customized using templating where current row data and column properties are passed to the body template. On the other hand, <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> properties of a column are used to define the content of these sections by accepting either simple string values or JSX for advanced content. Similarly <code>DataTable</code> itself also provides <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> properties for the main header and footer of the table.
  size:
    title: DataTable Size
    description: In addition to the regular table, a smal and a large version are available with different paddings.

    content: DataTable provides single and multiple selection modes on click of a row or cell. Selected rows are bound to the <code>selection</code> property for reading and updated using <code>onSelectionChange</code> callback. Column based selection can be done using radio buttons or checkboxes using <code>selectionMode</code> of a particular column. In addition <code>onRowSelect</code>-<code>onRowUnselect</code> / <code>onCellSelect</code>-<code>onCellUnselect</code> events are provided as optional callbacks.
  edit:
    title: DataTable Edit
    description: Row editing provides a rapid and user friendly way to manipulate data. Row editing toggles the visibility of the all editors in the row at once and provides additional options to save and cancel editing.
