  templating:
    title: TreeTable Templating
    description: Custom content at header, body and footer sections are supported via templating.
  pagination:
    title: TreeTable Pagination
    description: Pagination is a separate component, which can be used with TreeTable. It supports a backend-based pagination with data fetching on every page click.
  sort:
    title: TreeTable Sort
    description: TreeTable supports both single column and multiple column sorting.
    content:
      body1: Enabling <code>sortable</code> property at column component would be enough to make a column sortable. The property to use when sorting is field by default and can be customized using <code>sortField</code>.
      body2: By default sorting is executed on the clicked column only. To enable multiple field sorting, set <code>sortMode</code> property to "multiple" and use metakey when clicking on another column.
      body3: In case you'd like to display the table as sorted per a single column by default on mount, use <code>sortField</code> and <code>sortOrder</code> properties in Controlled or Uncontrolled manner. In controlled mode, <code>sortField</code>, <code>sortOrder</code> and <code>onSort</code> properties need to be defined to control the sorting state.
      body4: In multiple mode, use the <code>multiSortMeta</code> property and bind an array of SortMeta objects instead.
      body5: In uncontrolled mode, no additional properties need to be enabled. Initial sort field can be still be provided using the <code>sortField</code> property in uncontrolled mode however it is evaluated at initial rendering and ignored in further updates. If you programmatically need to update the sorting state, prefer to use the component as controlled.
      body6: To customize sorting algorithm, set sortable option to custom and define a <code>sortFunction</code> that sorts the list.
  selection:
    title: TreeTable Selection
    description: TreeTable supports single, multiple and checkbox based selection modes.
  colgroup:
    title: TreeTable Column Grouping
    description: Columns can be grouped at header and footer using <code>headerColumnGroup</code> and <code>footerColumnGroup</code> components that both define an array of columns each having colspan and rowspan.
  edit:
    title: TreeTable Edit
    description: Incell editing feature provides a way to quickly edit data inside the table. A cell editor is defined using the <code>editor</code> property that refers to a function to return an input element for the editing. Clicking outside the cell or hitting enter key closes the cell, however this may not be desirable if the input is invalid. In order to decide whether to keep the cell open or not, provide a <code>cellEditValidator</code> function that validates the value.
  scroll:
    title: TreeTable Scroll
    description: Scrolling data is available horizontally, vertically or both with optional support for frozen columns.
    content:
      body1: TreeTable supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling as well as frozen columns. Vertical scrolling is enabled using <code>scrollable</code> property and <code>scrollHeight</code> to define the viewport height.
      body2: Horizontal Scrolling requires a width of TreeTable to be defined and explicit widths on columns.
      body3: Certain columns can be frozen by using the <code>frozen</code> property of the column component. Widths of the frozen section is specified by the <code>frozenWidth</code> property.
      body4: Note that frozen columns are enabled, frozen and scrollable cells may have content with varying height which leads to misalignment. Provide fixed height to cells to avoid alignment issues.
      body5: When using frozen columns with column grouping, use <code>frozenHeaderColumnGroup</code> and <code>frozenFooterColumnGroup</code> properties along <code>withheaderColumnGroup</code> and <code>footerColumnGroup</code>.
  style:
    title: TreeTable Styling
    description: Particular rows and cells can be styled based on data.
